- **New Device Profile** - D2-01-12 (Electronic Switch with Energy Measurement)

### 🔧 Technical Details
- Added search input field above EEP profile dropdown
- Real-time filtering using JavaScript
- Case-insensitive search across code, title, and description
- Stores all profiles in memory for instant filtering
- D2-01-12 profile includes switch, energy (Wh), and power (W) entities

- `addon/config.yaml` - Version bump to 1.0.34

### 💡 Usage Examples
```
Search: "switch" → Shows all switch profiles
Search: "D2-01" → Shows D2-01 family
Search: "temperature" → Shows temperature sensors
Search: "energy" → Shows energy monitoring devices
```

### 🎯 Benefits
- ✅ 10x faster profile selection
- ✅ No more scrolling through 150+ profiles
- ✅ Find profiles by function, not just code
- ✅ Better user experience
- ✅ Scalable to 500+ profiles

## v1.0.33 - State Feedback & Command Confirmation (2025-12-15)

### 📡 New Features
- **Command Confirmation Tracking** - Know when commands are actually executed
- **Response Time Measurement** - Track device performance (e.g., 0.32s)
- **Timeout Detection** - Identify failed commands automatically
- **State Feedback** - Real confirmation instead of pure optimistic updates
- **Background Cleanup** - Automatic cleanup of expired commands

### 🔧 Technical Details
- New `CommandTracker` class with pending command management
- Automatic confirmation detection when device responds
- 5-second timeout for command confirmation
- 5% tolerance for numeric value matching (brightness, position)
- Async callback support for confirmations and timeouts
- Statistics tracking (pending, confirmed, timed-out)

### 📝 New Files
- `addon/rootfs/app/core/command_tracker.py` - Command tracking module (350+ lines)

### 📝 Modified Files
- `addon/rootfs/app/main.py` - Tracker integration and callbacks
- `addon/config.yaml` - Version bump to 1.0.33
- `addon/rootfs/app/web_ui/templates/dashboard_full.html` - Version update

### 💡 How It Works
1. Command sent → Tracked with expected state
2. Device responds → Telegram received
3. Tracker checks if state matches expected
4. If match → Confirmation logged with response time
5. If timeout → Warning logged
6. Optimistic update still published immediately
7. Real state confirmed or timeout detected

### 📊 Example Log Output
```
🎮 COMMAND RECEIVED
   Device: Smart Plug
   Command: {"state": "ON"}
   ✅ Command sent successfully!
   📋 Tracking command for confirmation (timeout: 5s)
   ✅ Published optimistic state

📡 TELEGRAM RECEIVED (0.3s later)
   ✅ COMMAND CONFIRMED
   Response time: 0.32s
   Confirmed state: {"switch": 1}
   🎯 Command confirmation processed
```

### 🎯 Benefits
- ✅ Know when commands are actually executed
- ✅ Detect failed commands (timeouts)
- ✅ Measure device response times
- ✅ Better debugging and monitoring
- ✅ Foundation for retry logic (future)
