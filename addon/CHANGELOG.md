- Both sensors configured with appropriate device_class
- RSSI uses signal_strength device class with dBm unit
- Last Seen uses timestamp device class

### Home Assistant Integration

## [1.0.10] - 2025-12-12

### Added
- **Enhanced Telegram Logging** - Comprehensive logging for all received telegrams
- Visual telegram display with emojis (📡 for normal, 🎓 for teach-in, ⚠️ for unknown)
- Hex dump of all telegram data for debugging
- Detailed parsing logs showing data extraction step-by-step
- Instructions in logs for adding detected devices

### Improved
- Teach-in telegrams now logged at WARNING level (highly visible)
- Unknown devices logged at WARNING level with device details
- Each telegram shows: Sender ID, RORG, RSSI, and full data hex
- Parser logs show data bytes being extracted and parsed values
- Better visibility for troubleshooting device communication

### Debugging
- All telegrams logged with full details
- Parser shows which bytes are being used
- Easy to identify if device is sending data
- Easy to see if parsing is working correctly
- Helps diagnose MQTT "unknown" value issues

## [1.0.9] - 2025-12-12

### Fixed
- **Device Action Buttons** - Fixed Edit, Pause/Enable, and Delete buttons using absolute paths
- All device action buttons now use relative paths and work correctly through ingress
- Fixed fetch calls for: edit device, toggle enable/disable, delete device

### Added
- **Auto-Detect Feature** - Replaced yellow "Add Device" card with "Auto-Detect" functionality
- Click Auto-Detect card to start listening for EnOcean teach-in telegrams (60 seconds)
- Visual countdown timer shows remaining time
- Click again to stop early
- Detected devices appear in addon logs
- Keeps blue "Add Device" button in device list header

### Improved
- Cleaner UI with only one "Add Device" button (blue button in header)
- Auto-Detect card provides teach-in functionality like other integrations
- Better user experience for adding new devices

## [1.0.8] - 2025-12-12

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Ingress Path Issue** - Fixed 404 errors caused by absolute API paths
- Changed all fetch() calls from `/api/...` to `api/...` (relative paths)
- This fixes the issue where API calls were going to wrong URLs through Home Assistant ingress
- All API endpoints now work correctly through ingress proxy

### Technical Details
- Problem: JavaScript was calling `/api/status` which resolved to `http://192.168.1.130:8123/api/status`
- Should be: `api/status` which resolves to ingress path + `api/status`
- Fixed all fetch calls: status, devices, eep-profiles, gateway-info, and all POST/PUT/DELETE operations
- Relative paths work correctly with Home Assistant's ingress proxy system

### Impact
- ✅ Fixes all 404 errors on API endpoints
- ✅ Status, Gateway, EEP Profiles, and Devices now load correctly
- ✅ Add/Edit/Delete device operations now work
- ✅ All modals display correct data

## [1.0.7] - 2025-12-12

### Added
- **Enhanced Logging** - Added detailed logging to all API endpoints for debugging
- Logs now show when each API endpoint is called
- Logs show service component availability (eep_loader, device_manager, mqtt_handler)
- Logs show actual data being returned from endpoints

### Fixed
- **Documentation** - Fixed misleading "150+ EEP profiles" claim
- Updated description to accurately reflect current MV-01-01 profile support
- Description now says "with more profiles coming soon"

### Debugging
- /api/status now logs service state and component availability
- /api/eep-profiles logs loader state and profile count
- /api/devices logs device manager state and device count
- All logs visible in addon logs for troubleshooting

## [1.0.6] - 2025-12-12

### Fixed
- **Critical: Service Initialization Order** - Fixed race condition causing 404 errors
- Service components now fully initialized BEFORE web UI starts accepting requests
- Moved `service_state.set_service()` call to AFTER `initialize()` completes
- This ensures eep_loader, device_manager, and mqtt_handler are available when API is called

### Technical Details
- Previously: service_state was set before initialization, causing components to be None
- Now: initialization completes first, then service is registered with state manager
- Web server still starts concurrently but components are guaranteed to exist
- Fixes 404 errors and JSON parsing issues caused by missing components

### Impact
- Resolves "Error loading devices" JSON parse errors
- Resolves 404 errors on /api/eep-profiles
- Resolves 404 errors on /api/status and /api/devices
- All API endpoints now work reliably on first load

- Simplified response handling throughout the application
- Better consistency across all endpoints

## [1.0.4] - 2025-12-12
